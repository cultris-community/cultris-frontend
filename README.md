# Early drafts #

This repository is for the new Cultris II web frontend.

For now, there are only some drafts I created in Photoshop. I included the PSD file so feel free to edit it. It's located in the `drafts\` folder.

There are also two a color swatches with colors taken from the Cultris II client. They're located in the `clolors\` folder. 

Ideas behind this layout:
 - Can be visually associated with Cultris
 - Rather simple
 - Scrollable when more space is needed

ToDos:
 - Finetune colors
 - Select font, current one is Helvetica Neue which is nice but rather unavailable outside of the Apple world
 - See how the layout works with more content
 - HTML implementation
